This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Also it contains below packages for internationalization.
1) i18next
2) i18next-browser-languagedetector
3) i18next-xhr-backend
4) react-i18next

The default settings are in src/i18n.js file. You can change those according to your requirements.
We have to provide translations so we are saving those in public/locales/languagePrefix/translations.json. Like public\locales\de\translations.json for all languages we are using we have to provide translations. 

For using it in your component import settings from src/i18n.js. You can check app.js to see example usage. Also for detail configs or syntax you can refer https://react.i18next.com/overview/getting-started. Also for complete examples you can browse https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next/tree/master/example.

"# react-i18n" 

Latest work is done against fixing dependabots and mitigating risks behind that.
